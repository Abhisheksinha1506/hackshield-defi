# HackShield

HackShield is a real-time DeFi exploit detection platform. Unlike traditional monitors that rely on statistical anomalies, HackShield uses exploit signatures from actual replayed Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) to identify attacks as they happen on-chain.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Identifies DeFi exploits as they occur.
- **PoC-Based Signatures:** Uses actual attack patterns for high precision and lower false positives.
- **Actionable Intelligence:** Provides specific alerts that allow protocols to take immediate action.
- **Advanced Monitoring:** Detects detectable on-chain patterns before funds are drained.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Animations:** Framer Motion / CSS Animations
